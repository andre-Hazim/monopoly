## General Information

<p>As of Milestone 1, this program simulates a text-based version of Monopoly for a default number of four players. Not all game features have been implemented yet but a player is able to roll their dice, buy or pass on properties, and pay rent to other players should they land on an owned property. The game ends when all but one player is bankrupt.</p>
